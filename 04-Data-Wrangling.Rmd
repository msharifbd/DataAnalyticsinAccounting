# Data Wrangling

Data wrangling is the process of cleaning data, so that data become ready for further manipulation such as visualization and modeling. Sometimes, data wrangling is also called `data munging`. More specifically, data wrangling involves transforming and mapping data frome one from to another form - particularly from *raw* form to *tidy* form.

There is an old saying that 90% of data science involves data wrangling. In many cases, data wrangling is difficult as it involves dealing with missing entries, ambiguous values, and different types of mixed data. In data analytics ecosystem in `R`, data wrangling involves three jobs - importing data into `R`, cleaning (tidying) the data, and tranforming the data. 

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Data Wrangling in R"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/data-science-wrangle.png', dpi = NA)
```

The first job - importing data into `R` - is discussed in chapter 03. In this chapter, cleaning (tidying) the data in `R` will be discussed. The last job will be discussed in next chapter - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 

## `tidy` data 

Data wrangling or data munging results in `tidy` data - which is storing data that makes further manipulation on data such as transformation, visualization, and modeling easier. The following rules make a dataset `tidy` - 

* Each variable must have its own column
* Each observation must have its own row
* Each value must have its own cell

## Tidying Messy Data

According to Hadley Wickham, "Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way" [@wickham_r_2017]. Messy data can be in many forms; for example - Wickham [-@wickham_tidy_2014] mentions the five *most common problems* with messy datasets. These problems include - 

* Column headers are values, not variable names
* Multiple variables are stored in one column
* Variables are stored in both rows and columns
* Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table
* A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables

### Column Hearders are Values, not Variable Names

The following dataset (`total_assets`) is an example of this case, in which the name of the variables (columns) are numbers. Though in some cases, this data format might be useful, in many cases usually it is not useful.  

```{r echo=FALSE, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
firms_fundametals <- readr::read_csv('C:/Users/mshar/OneDrive - Southern Illinois University/TEACHING/DATA ANALYTICS/MY BOOK_ACCOUNTING ANALYTICS/ACCT_ANALYTICS_BOOK_04_23_2020/daina/data-raw/firms_fundamentals.csv')

total_assets <- read_csv(
  "C:/Users/mshar/OneDrive - Southern Illinois University/TEACHING/DATA ANALYTICS/MY BOOK_ACCOUNTING ANALYTICS/ACCT_ANALYTICS_BOOK_04_23_2020/daina/data-raw/total_assets.csv"
)

netincome_asset <- read_csv(
  "C:/Users/mshar/OneDrive - Southern Illinois University/TEACHING/DATA ANALYTICS/MY BOOK_ACCOUNTING ANALYTICS/ACCT_ANALYTICS_BOOK_04_23_2020/daina/data-raw/netincome_asset.csv"
)

sales_profit <- read_csv(
  "C:/Users/mshar/OneDrive - Southern Illinois University/TEACHING/DATA ANALYTICS/MY BOOK_ACCOUNTING ANALYTICS/ACCT_ANALYTICS_BOOK_04_23_2020/daina/data-raw/sales_profit.csv"
)
```

```{r}
total_assets
```

### Multiple Variables are Stored in One Column

The `netincome_asset` dataset is a good example of this kind of dataset. For example, the variable `VALUES` includes `net income` and `total assets` separated by `/`. This variable is very hard to manipulate. For example, if we want to calculate `Return on Assets (ROA)`, which equals to net income divided by total assets, then it is not possible to use `VALUES` column to calculate `ROA`. 

```{r}
netincome_asset
```

### Variables are Stored in Both Rows and Columns

The `sales_profit` dataset is an example of this type. Here in the `ITEM` column, actually variables are included (such as `SALES` and `NETINCOME`). Also, the columns such as `2000` through `2004` should be a variable (e.g., `year`).

```{r}
sales_profit 
```

### Multiple Types of Observational Units are Stored in the Same Table

## `tidyr` Package for `tidy` Data 

The `tidyr` package is widley used to `tidy` data in `R`. Specifically, `pivot_longer`, `pivot_wider`, `separate`, and `extract` functions are widely used to make a messy data into `tidy`. 


### `pivot_longer ()` function 

If the `total_assets` dataset above (Column headers are values, not variable names) is made `tidy` using `pivot_longer` function, then it will be look like this (Assuming the name of the dataset is variable_number) - 

```{r}
# using pivot_longer () function 
total_assets %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -c("TICKER", "COMPANYNAME"),
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "TOTALASSETS"
               ) %>% 
  head()
```

There are several arguments of `pivot_longer` function. Here three arguments are used. The `cols` argument specifies which columns should (not) be used in `pivot_longer` function. In this case, we select the variables that should not be used while using `pivot_longer` function. The second argument `names_to` specifies the name of the variable in which existing column values will be stored and finally `values_to` specifies the name of the column in which the cell values will be stored. Now, the dataset is a `tidy` dataset. 

### `pivot_wider ()` function 

The `sales_profit` dataset can be put into `tidy` format using both `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider` function.  

```{r}
sales_profit %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !c ("TICKER", "COMPANYNAME", "ITEM"),
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "AMOUNT"
  ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = ITEM, 
    values_from = AMOUNT
  )
```

### `separate ()` function 

The `separate` function can be used when multiple variables are stored in one column. The function separates one column into multiple columns. For example, in `netincome_asset` data, the column `VALUES` should be converted into two columns called `NETINCOME` and `TOTALASSETS`. In `separate` function, `col` argument is ued to select the column that needs to be broken; `into` argument is used to create new columns; and `sep` argument is ued to identify the character in which the column will be separated. In this case, it is `/`. Finally `remove` argument is used to decide whether the column (here `VALUES`) that is separated should be in new dataset.  

```{r}
netincome_asset %>% 
  separate(
    col = VALUES, into = c ("NETINCMOE", "TOTALASSETS"), sep ="/",
    remove =TRUE
  )
```

It is clear from the above dataset that the type of columns `NETINCOME` and `TOTALASSETS` are `chr`, but they should be number (e.g., `dbl`). Actually, `separate` functions maintain the type of the columns that are separated. The type of `VALUES` column was `chr` and it is maintained in new dataset. In order to get the true type, we can use `convert` argument, which is done below.  

```{r}
netincome_asset  %>% 
  separate(
    col = VALUES, into = c ("NETINCMOE", "TOTALASSETS"), sep ="/",
    remove =TRUE,convert = TRUE
  )
```

### `extract ()` function
